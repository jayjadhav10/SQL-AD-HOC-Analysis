Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for conducting ad-hoc data analysis to extract valuable insights and answer business questions. The analysis focuses on dynamic querying and problem-solving without predefined reporting structures.

Project Objectives
Perform flexible and exploratory data analysis using SQL queries.
Answer specific business questions to inform decision-making.
Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data.
Dataset
The dataset includes fictional/generated/real-world data from [source name]. The data covers the following areas:

[List data domains: e.g., Sales, Customer Behavior, Transactions, etc.]
Key columns include [Column1, Column2, ..., ColumnN].
Analysis Performed
The project includes the following SQL queries and techniques:

Data Exploration:

Overview of the dataset (record counts, distinct values, etc.).
Checking for data quality (nulls, duplicates).
Business Metrics Calculation:

Revenue, average sales, and profit margin computations.
Customer segmentation and trends.
Trend Analysis:

Monthly/yearly growth patterns.
Identifying peak periods or seasons.
Anomaly Detection:

Detecting outliers in sales or revenue.
Highlighting unusual customer behavior.
Performance Analysis:

Best-performing products, regions, and sales representatives.
Underperforming areas requiring intervention.
Key Findings
Key insights derived from the analysis include:
[Finding 1: e.g., Top 5 products contributing 60% of revenue.]
[Finding 2: e.g., High churn rate in specific regions.]
[Finding 3: e.g., Revenue trends by seasonality.]
Technologies Used
SQL Database: [Specify the database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server].
Tools for Visualization (if any): [e.g., Power BI, Tableau].
