### Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for conducting ad-hoc data analysis to extract valuable insights and answer business questions. The goal is to answer specific business questions and uncover insights.

### Project Objectives
* Use SQL to explore data and find answers to business questions.
- Look for trends, patterns, and problems in the data.
+ Share insights that can help in decision-making.

### Analysis Performed
The project covers the following SQL tasks:

1.  Provide the list of markets in which customer  "Atliq  Exclusive"  operates its 
business in the  APAC  region.
2.  What is the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020? The 
final output contains these fields, <br/>
unique_products_2020 <br/>
unique_products_2021 <br/>
percentage_chg 
3.  Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each  segment  and 
sort them in descending order of product counts. The final output contains 
2 fields, <br/>
segment <br/>
product_count <br/>

and more...

### Key Insights
